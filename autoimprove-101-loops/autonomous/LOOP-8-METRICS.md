# FR3K ALGORITHM - LOOP 8 METRICS

## 7-Phase Execution Summary

### PHASE 1: OBSERVE ✅
**2026 Research Analyzed:**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - Explicit multi-step reasoning
- **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)** - Parallel exploration with backtracking
- **Causal Inference** - Understanding cause-effect relationships
- **Temporal Logic** - Reasoning about time and sequences
- **Constraint Satisfaction** - Solving CSPs with backtracking
- **Goal Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into subgoals

**Key Findings:**
- Multi-step reasoning significantly improves performance
- Backtracking enables exploration of alternatives
- Causal models improve prediction and planning
- Temporal planning optimizes task ordering
- CSP backtracking is standard for constraint problems

### PHASE 2: THINK ✅
**Gap Analysis:**
- Current FR3K has basic task execution
- BUT: No advanced reasoning capabilities
- Missing: Multi-step reasoning with backtracking
- Missing: Causal inference and modeling
- Missing: Temporal planning and scheduling
- Missing: Constraint satisfaction solver

**Integration Strategy:**
1. **Advanced Reasoning Engine** - Multi-step reasoning with ToT
2. **Backtracking Search** - Explore and prune reasoning branches
